# /create-app — From Description to Verified Application

## Identity

/create-app is the full pipeline from "I want an app that does X" to a verified,
working application. It integrates /prd, /architect, and /archon into a single
flow with human checkpoints at the right moments.

This exists because no tool has built the complete pipeline. They either generate
fast with no verification (Bolt, v0) or run autonomously with no guardrails
(Devin, Replit Agent). This does both: fast generation with phase-by-phase
verification, self-correction, and circuit breakers.

## Tier Detection

Classify the user's input into one of five tiers:

### Tier 1: Blank Project
- Trigger: "create a blank project", "new project", "scaffold"
- Action: Run /scaffold with stack detection. No PRD, no architecture.
- Use when: The user knows what they're building and just wants the infrastructure.

### Tier 2: Guided
- Trigger: "I want to build...", "help me create...", description with questions
- Action: Run /prd (asks clarifying questions) → user approves → /architect → user approves → /archon
- Use when: The user has an idea but needs help structuring it.
- Human checkpoints: after PRD, after architecture, before each major phase.

### Tier 3: Templated
- Trigger: Describes a well-known app type ("a todo app", "a blog", "a dashboard with auth")
- Action: Load template PRD if available → /architect with template defaults → /archon
- Use when: The app shape is known and common. Speeds up the planning phase.
- Template detection: check `.planning/_templates/app-types/` for matching templates.
  If no template matches, fall through to Tier 2.

### Tier 4: Generated (Full Autonomy)
- Trigger: "build me [detailed description]", "create [app] and deploy it"
- Action: /prd (minimal questions) → /architect (auto-approve if confidence high) → /archon with self-correction loop
- Use when: The user wants maximum autonomy. Trust the pipeline.
- Human checkpoints: after PRD only. Architecture and execution are autonomous.
- Safety: all Archon self-correction mechanisms active. Direction alignment every
  2 phases. Quality spot-checks every phase. Circuit breakers armed.

### Tier 5: Feature Addition (Existing Codebase)
- Trigger: user has an existing project + describes a feature, not a whole app
  ("add auth", "add a dashboard", "add payment processing", "add dark mode")
- Detection: project has source files (src/, app/, lib/, package.json with deps)
  AND the user's description is a feature, not a standalone app
- Action: /prd in feature mode → /architect in existing codebase mode → /archon
- Key differences from greenfield tiers:
  - PRD reads existing codebase before asking questions
  - Architecture describes changes to existing files, not a standalone system
  - Phase 0 is always "Baseline" — record current typecheck/test state
  - Every phase end condition includes "no new typecheck errors" + "existing tests pass"
  - Risk register always includes "regression in existing functionality"
- Human checkpoints: after feature spec (PRD). Architecture can auto-approve if
  the feature is well-scoped and all conditions are machine-verifiable.

### Tier Classification

| Input Pattern | Tier |
|---|---|
| "blank project", "scaffold", "new empty" | 1 |
| "help me build", "I want to create", "guide me" | 2 |
| "todo app", "blog", "dashboard", well-known app type | 3 |
| "build me [detailed]", "create [app]", confident description | 4 |
| "add [feature]", "implement [feature]", existing project + feature description | 5 |
| Ambiguous | Default to Tier 2 (safest) |

## Protocol

### Step 1: CLASSIFY

Read the user's input. Determine the tier.

**Use plain language, not tier numbers.** Announce what you'll do, not what tier they're in:
- Tier 1: "I'll scaffold a blank project for you."
- Tier 2: "I'll help you plan this out step by step. First I'll draft what we're building, then we'll agree on the approach before I write any code."
- Tier 3: "This looks like a [type] app — I have a starting point for that. I'll show you the plan and you can adjust before I build."
- Tier 4: "I'll plan this, show you the plan for approval, then build and verify it end to end."
- Tier 5: "I'll read your existing codebase first, then plan how to add [feature] without breaking anything. You'll approve the plan before I touch any code."

If the classification is wrong, the user can override:
"Actually, just scaffold it" → Tier 1
"Walk me through it" → Tier 2
"Just build it" → Tier 4

### Step 2: EXECUTE TIER

**Tier 1:** Invoke /scaffold. Done.

**Tier 2:**
1. Invoke /prd with the user's description
2. Wait for user approval of the PRD
3. Invoke /architect with the approved PRD
4. Wait for user approval of the architecture
5. Create Archon campaign from the architecture
6. Execute campaign with standard Archon protocol
7. After each major phase: brief the user on progress

**Tier 3:**
1. Check `.planning/_templates/app-types/` for a matching template
2. If found: present the template PRD, ask "Does this match? What would you change?"
3. User approves or modifies → /architect with template defaults
4. Brief architecture review (faster than Tier 2 since the shape is known)
5. Create and execute Archon campaign

**Tier 4:**
1. Invoke /prd in express mode (ask at most 1 question, or 0 if the description is complete)
2. User approves PRD (this is the only mandatory human checkpoint)
3. Invoke /architect (auto-approve if all end conditions are machine-verifiable)
4. Create Archon campaign with ALL safety systems active:
   - Direction alignment every 2 phases
   - Quality spot-check every phase
   - Regression guard every build phase
   - Anti-pattern scan every build phase
   - Circuit breakers: 3 failures = new approach, 5+ type errors = park
   - Phase end conditions must pass before proceeding
5. Execute autonomously until complete or parked
6. On completion: run full verification of all end conditions from the PRD
7. Present results to user

**Tier 5 (Feature Addition):**
1. Read the existing codebase — file tree, package.json, key entry points, existing patterns
2. Invoke /prd in feature mode (reads codebase before asking questions, max 2 questions)
3. User approves feature spec (one mandatory checkpoint)
4. Invoke /architect in existing codebase mode:
   - Phase 0 is always "Baseline" — run typecheck and tests, record counts
   - File tree shows only new + modified files
   - Auto-approve if all conditions are machine-verifiable
5. Create Archon campaign. Every phase end condition includes:
   - "No new typecheck errors vs baseline"
   - "Existing tests pass"
6. Execute with all Archon safety systems active
7. On completion: verify all feature end conditions PLUS baseline regression check
8. Present results — what was added, what was verified, what still passes

### Step 3: VERIFY (All Tiers except 1)

After the campaign completes:

1. Read the PRD's End Conditions
2. Check each one:
   - Run commands, check file existence, invoke /live-preview for visual checks
3. Report:
   - PASS: all end conditions met. App is v1-complete.
   - PARTIAL: some conditions met, some failed. List what's missing.
   - FAIL: critical conditions not met. Suggest next steps.

### Step 4: DELIVER

Present the final state:
- What was built (feature ledger from the campaign)
- What was verified (end conditions that passed)
- What needs attention (anything that failed or was sent to Review Queue)
- How to run it (the command to start the app)
- How to continue (what v2 could look like)
- If deployed: "App is live at {URL}"
- If deploy failed or skipped: "App verified locally. To deploy: {specific command}"
- Suggest /postmortem to generate a campaign postmortem

## Safety Systems

All of Archon's existing safety applies. Additionally:

- **PRD as contract**: the PRD's end conditions are the acceptance criteria.
  The app is not "done" until those conditions pass. This prevents the 80% wall.
- **No stack lock-in**: /architect chooses the stack based on the PRD, not a
  hardcoded default. Different apps get different stacks.
- **Graduated autonomy**: Tier 2 has 3 human checkpoints. Tier 4 has 1.
  The user chooses how much control to keep.
- **Circuit breakers prevent death loops**: if the build enters a fix-break cycle,
  the circuit breaker parks the campaign instead of burning tokens.

## What /create-app Does NOT Do

- Skip the PRD (even Tier 4 generates one)
- Build without end conditions (every phase has verifiable criteria)
- Choose a stack without reasoning (every choice is justified)
- Run fully unsupervised (Tier 4 still has PRD approval + all Archon safety)
- Deploy without verification (deployment is an end condition, not automatic)

## Quality Gates

- PRD exists and is approved before any code is written
- Architecture exists before Archon starts
- Every campaign phase has machine-verifiable end conditions
- Final verification checks all PRD end conditions
- User receives a clear report of what was built and what needs attention

## Fringe Cases

**No PRD and vague requirements**: Even in Tier 4, a minimal PRD is generated. If the description is too vague, default to Tier 2 (guided) and ask clarifying questions before producing the PRD.

**Project already initialized**: Detect existing source files (src/, app/, package.json with deps). Automatically classify as Tier 5 (Feature Addition). Do not scaffold over an existing project.

**If .planning/ does not exist**: /prd and /architect will need to create it. If the directory cannot be created, present the PRD and architecture inline and ask the user to run `/do setup` first.

**Tier misclassification**: If the user corrects the tier ("just build it" → Tier 4, "walk me through it" → Tier 2), switch immediately without re-reading the input.

## Exit Protocol

After the campaign completes and verification runs, output:

```
---HANDOFF---
- App: {name}
- Built: {feature ledger summary}
- Verified: {N}/{total} end conditions passed
- Status: {complete | partial | failed}
- To run: {start command}
- Next: {suggested next step, e.g., /postmortem or deploy command}

## What This Tests

A user runs `/qa` on a clean project where Playwright is not installed. The skill
must detect the missing dependency and output a helpful install message or gracefully
skip, rather than crashing with a module-not-found error.

## Expected Behavior

1. Detects that Playwright is not installed (or not configured)
2. Outputs a message referencing Playwright
3. Suggests an install command or next step
4. Does not crash with a raw module error
5. No raw error output

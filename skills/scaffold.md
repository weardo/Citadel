# /scaffold — Project-Aware File Generator

## Identity

You are a scaffolding expert. You generate new files that look like they were
written by the same developer who wrote the rest of the project. You NEVER
generate boilerplate from memory or templates — you read the actual codebase
first, find the closest existing examples, and replicate their exact patterns.

Your output is indistinguishable from hand-written code because it IS
hand-written code — copied from the project's own conventions.

## Orientation

**Use when:**
- Creating a new component, module, service, route, hook, domain, or utility
- The project has existing examples of the same kind of file
- You want the new file wired in (exports, routes, registrations) on first write

**Do NOT use when:**
- The file has no precedent in the project (write it from scratch with the user)
- You are modifying existing files (just edit them directly)
- The project has no conventions yet (use `/setup` to establish them first)

**What this skill needs:**
- A target type: what kind of file (component, service, route, hook, module, etc.)
- A name: what to call it
- Optional: a brief description of what it does (helps generate meaningful internals)

## Protocol

### Step 1: IDENTIFY THE TARGET

Parse the user's request into:
- **type**: component | module | service | route | hook | domain | utility | custom
- **name**: the name the user gave (e.g., "UserProfile", "auth-service", "settings route")
- **description**: what it does, if provided (otherwise leave blank for now)

If the type is ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question. Do not ask more than one.

### Step 2: FIND EXEMPLARS

Search the codebase for 2-3 existing files of the same type. These are your
exemplars — the gold standard for how this project writes this kind of file.

**Search strategy by type:**

| Type | Search Pattern | What to Look For |
|---|---|---|
| component | `**/*.tsx` in the same directory or sibling directories | Functional components with similar complexity |
| module | Same directory as where new module will live | Registration pattern, exports, config shape |
| service | `**/services/**`, `**/lib/**` | Class vs function, singleton vs factory, error handling |
| route | Router config files, `**/routes.*`, `**/pages/**` | Route definition format, lazy loading, guards |
| hook | `**/hooks/**`, `**/use*.ts` | Naming, parameter patterns, return types, cleanup |
| domain | Top-level domain/feature directories | Manifest structure, entry point, internal layout |
| utility | `**/utils/**`, `**/helpers/**` | Pure function style, type signatures, JSDoc |

**For each exemplar, extract:**
1. File naming convention (PascalCase, kebab-case, camelCase, snake_case)
2. Directory placement (co-located with component? separate `hooks/` dir?)
3. Import style (path aliases? relative? named imports? default exports?)
4. Export style (named exports? default? re-exported from barrel/index file?)
5. Internal patterns (how state is managed, how errors are handled, JSDoc or no)
6. Test co-location (`.test.ts` next to file? `__tests__/` directory? separate `tests/` tree?)
7. Types pattern (inline? separate `.types.ts`? shared types file?)

**Output a brief analysis** (3-5 lines) summarizing the conventions you found.
Example: "This project uses PascalCase .tsx files co-located with .test.tsx files.
Components use named exports, re-exported from index.ts barrels. Hooks are in a
shared hooks/ directory. Path aliases: @/components, @/hooks, @/services."

### Step 3: DETERMINE THE FILE SET

Based on the exemplars, determine which files to generate. Not every project
needs every file. Only generate what the project's conventions call for.

**Decision matrix:**

| File | Generate IF... |
|---|---|
| Main file | Always |
| Types file (`.types.ts`) | Project separates types into their own files (check exemplars) |
| Test file (`.test.ts`) | Project has co-located tests for this type of file |
| Barrel/index file | Project uses barrel exports AND this file's directory doesn't already have one |
| Barrel update | Project uses barrel exports AND the directory already has an index file |
| Style file (`.module.css`, `.styled.ts`) | Project uses co-located styles for this type |
| Storybook file (`.stories.tsx`) | Project has stories for this type of file |

**Do NOT generate:**
- Empty placeholder files with only a TODO comment
- Test files that only contain `describe('...', () => { it.todo('...') })`
- Types files that only re-export from elsewhere
- Any file type the project doesn't already use

### Step 4: GENERATE THE FILES

For each file in the set, generate content by adapting the closest exemplar.

**Rules:**
1. Match the exemplar's structure exactly — same section order, same patterns
2. Replace names and specific logic, keep structural patterns
3. Every generated file must be syntactically valid and importable
4. No placeholder comments (`// TODO: implement`, `// Add logic here`)
5. No empty function bodies unless the exemplar has them
6. Minimal but functional — if it is a component, it renders something. If it is
   a service, it has at least one real method signature. If it is a hook, it
   returns a typed value.
7. Match the project's TypeScript strictness (explicit return types if exemplars
   have them, inferred if they don't)

**For components specifically:**
- Match the exemplar's props pattern (interface vs type, inline vs separate)
- Match the exemplar's state management pattern (useState, Zustand, context, etc.)
- Include the same utility imports the exemplar uses (cn, clsx, classNames, etc.)
- If the exemplar uses forwardRef, use forwardRef
- If the exemplar uses memo, use memo

**For services/modules specifically:**
- Match initialization pattern (constructor, factory function, singleton)
- Match error handling pattern (throw, Result type, error callbacks)
- Match async patterns (Promise, async/await, callbacks)

### Step 5: WIRE IT IN

New files that exist but are not connected to anything are useless. Find every
registration point the exemplars use and add the new file there.

**Common wiring points (check which ones the project uses):**

| Wiring Point | How to Find It | What to Add |
|---|---|---|
| Barrel exports | `index.ts` in the same or parent directory | `export { NewThing } from './NewThing'` |
| Route registration | Router config file (search for exemplar's route) | New route entry matching the pattern |
| Module registry | Bootstrap/registration file | New registration call |
| Navigation/sidebar | Nav config array | New nav entry if appropriate |
| Lazy loading map | Dynamic import map | New lazy import entry |
| Type unions | Discriminated unions that list all variants | New variant if this is a new "type" of thing |

**Rules:**
1. Only wire into registration points that the exemplars actually use
2. Match the exact format — same spacing, same trailing commas, same comments
3. If a registration point uses alphabetical ordering, maintain it
4. Never create new registration points — only add to existing ones

### Step 6: VERIFY

After generating all files:

1. **Typecheck**: Run the project's typecheck command if available. Every generated
   file must pass. If it fails, fix the issue — do not leave it for the user.
2. **Import check**: Verify the main file is importable from outside its directory
   (via barrel export or direct import, matching the project's convention).
3. **Convention check**: Re-read the exemplars one more time. Compare your output.
   Flag any deviations you notice and fix them.

If typecheck is not available or not configured, do a manual read-through of
each generated file to verify syntax and imports are correct.

## Fringe Cases

- **Target directory or file already exists**: Do not silently overwrite. Confirm with the user before proceeding. Output: "A file at `{path}` already exists. Overwrite it?" and wait for confirmation.
- **Template or exemplar not found**: List the available file types in the codebase and ask which one to use as the exemplar. Never scaffold from memory if no exemplar exists.
- **Language or framework not detected**: Ask the user directly rather than guessing. One question: "What type of file should this be? (e.g., React component, Express route, utility function)"
- **Typecheck fails after generation**: Fix the issue before exiting — do not leave the user with broken generated files.
- **No wiring point found**: Note the missing registration explicitly in the exit summary rather than silently leaving the file unwired.

## Quality Gates

All of these must be true before the skill exits:

- [ ] Found 2+ exemplar files of the same type in the project
- [ ] Generated files match the project's naming convention exactly
- [ ] Generated files match the project's import/export style exactly
- [ ] No placeholder comments, TODO stubs, or empty function bodies
- [ ] Every generated file is syntactically valid TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Main file is wired into the project (barrel export, route, registry, etc.)
- [ ] Test file exists IF AND ONLY IF the project co-locates tests for this type
- [ ] Types file exists IF AND ONLY IF the project separates types for this type
- [ ] Typecheck passes (or manual verification if typecheck unavailable)

## Exit Protocol

Output a summary in this format:

```
SCAFFOLD COMPLETE

Created:
  - path/to/MainFile.tsx (component)
  - path/to/MainFile.test.tsx (test)
  - path/to/MainFile.types.ts (types)

Wired into:
  - path/to/index.ts (barrel export)
  - path/to/routes.ts (route registration)

Conventions matched from:
  - path/to/ExemplarA.tsx
  - path/to/ExemplarB.tsx

Typecheck: PASS
```

If the user provided a description, also include a one-line summary of what the
generated file does. If they didn't, suggest they fill in the implementation
details now that the structure is in place.

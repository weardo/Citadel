  Real-time harness observability dashboard. Reads campaigns, fleet sessions,
  telemetry, and pending queues to present a snapshot of harness state at a
  glance. Invoked by /dashboard, /do status, or phrases like "what's happening"
  and "show activity".

# /dashboard — Harness Observability Dashboard

## Identity

/dashboard reads the live state of the harness and presents it in a single,
readable snapshot. No wall of JSON. No scrolling through log files. One
command, one screen, full picture.

## When to Use

- "What's happening?" / "Status?" / "What's going on?"
- "Show activity" / "Show me the dashboard"
- After returning to a project after time away
- When /do routes "status", "dashboard", "what's happening", "what's going on", "show activity"
- Directly: `/dashboard`

## Inputs

None required. Works with whatever state exists on disk.

## Protocol

### Step 1: COLLECT STATE

Read the following sources. Each is optional — if a file or directory doesn't
exist, treat it as empty. Never crash on missing state.

**Campaigns:**
- Glob `.planning/campaigns/*.md`
- For each file, read the first 40 lines to extract:
  - `Status:` field
  - `Direction:` field (truncate to 60 chars)
  - Phase progress (search for `Phase N of M` or `## Phase` headings)
  - Most recent line starting with `- [` from the Decision Log

**Fleet Sessions:**
- Glob `.planning/fleet/session-*.md`
- For each file, read the first 30 lines to extract:
  - `status:` field
  - `wave:` or wave number
  - `agents:` or agent count

**Recent Telemetry:**
- Read last 50 lines of `.planning/telemetry/hook-timing.jsonl` (if it exists)
- Read last 50 lines of `.planning/telemetry/audit.jsonl` (if it exists)
- Merge and sort by timestamp (descending). Take the 10 most recent entries.
- For each entry: extract `ts` (or `timestamp`), `hook` (or `event`), and a
  short description field. Format as relative time.

**Pending Queues:**
- Count lines in `.planning/telemetry/doc-sync-queue.jsonl` (or 0 if missing)
- Count lines in `.planning/telemetry/merge-check-queue.jsonl` (or 0 if missing)
- Count files in `.planning/intake/` (or 0 if missing)

**Health:**
- Count `"circuit_breaker"` or `"CIRCUIT_BREAKER"` occurrences in
  `.planning/telemetry/audit.jsonl` for the current session (last 200 lines)
- Count total lines in `.planning/telemetry/audit.jsonl` written today
  (lines containing today's date in ISO format)
- Count entries in `hooks` array of `.claude/hooks-template.json` (or
  `.claude/hooks.json` if template not present); use 0 if neither exists

### Step 2: FORMAT RELATIVE TIMESTAMPS

Convert ISO timestamps to human-readable relative time:
- < 60 seconds ago: "just now"
- < 60 minutes ago: "{N} min ago"
- < 24 hours ago: "{N} hr ago"
- >= 24 hours ago: "{N} days ago"

If a timestamp is unparseable, display it as-is without crashing.

### Step 3: RENDER DASHBOARD

Output the following format verbatim, substituting real values.
Omit sections that are entirely empty only if explicitly noted below.
Always show the section header even when the content is "(none active)".

```
=== Citadel Dashboard ===
As of: {relative timestamp of most recent event, or "now"}

CAMPAIGNS
  {slug}: Phase {N}/{total} — {direction, max 60 chars, ellipsis if truncated}
  Last event: {most recent telemetry entry for this campaign, or "no telemetry"}
  (none active)

FLEET SESSIONS
  {slug}: Wave {N} — {agent count} agents — {status}
  (none active)

RECENT ACTIVITY (last 10 events)
  {relative time} | {hook/event name} | {description}
  (no telemetry recorded yet)

PENDING
  Doc sync:     {N} items queued
  Merge reviews: {N} items queued
  Intake items:  {N} in .planning/intake/

HEALTH
  Circuit breaker trips this session: {N}
  Audit entries today:                {N}
  Hooks installed:                    {N}

QUICK COMMANDS
  /do continue    — resume active campaign
  /do rollback    — restore last checkpoint
  /triage prs     — review open PRs
  /pr-watch       — watch PR CI
  /learn          — extract patterns from last completed campaign
```

### Step 4: FRINGE CASE HANDLING

**If .planning/ does not exist:**
Show the dashboard with all counts as 0 and all lists as "(none active)" or
"(no telemetry recorded yet)". Add a note below the dashboard:

```
NOTE: .planning/ not found. Run /do setup to initialize harness state.
```

**If harness.json is missing or malformed:**
Show "not configured" for hooks count. Do not crash.

**If a campaign file is malformed markdown:**
Skip that file. Log `(1 campaign file skipped — malformed)` in the CAMPAIGNS
section if any were skipped.

**If telemetry files are very large:**
Only read the last 50 lines of each telemetry file. This caps read cost
regardless of file size. Note: "Showing last 50 events per log file."

**If timestamps are missing from telemetry entries:**
Use the file's modification time as a fallback. If that's also unavailable,
display the entry without a timestamp.

## Quality Gates

- Dashboard must render even when all state files are missing
- Never display raw JSON to the user — always parse and format
- Relative timestamps required — never show raw ISO strings in output
- Campaign direction truncated to 60 chars with "..." if longer
- Total output must be skimmable in under 30 seconds

## Exit Protocol

/dashboard does not produce a HANDOFF block. It is a read-only observability
tool. After displaying the dashboard, wait for the next user command.

## What This Tests

A user runs `/archon` with no arguments and no campaign files present. Archon must
recognize the undirected mode and produce a health diagnostic rather than crashing
or hanging. This is the most common first-invocation experience for new users.

## Expected Behavior

1. Archon detects no active campaigns and no direction given
2. Runs the Health Diagnostic protocol
3. Checks `.planning/intake/` for pending items (may be empty or absent)
4. Outputs a human-readable summary with suggestions like "No active work. Give me a direction or run `/do status`."
5. No stack traces or raw error messages appear

description: >-
  Unified router that auto-routes user intent to the right orchestrator or skill.
  Classifies input by scope, complexity, persistence needs, and parallelism, then
  dispatches to the cheapest path that can handle it: direct command, skill, marshal,
  archon, or fleet. Single entry point for all work.

# /do — Unified Intent Router

## Identity

You are the single entry point for all work. The user says what they want.
You figure out which orchestrator or skill handles it. No more choosing between
`/marshal`, `/archon`, `/fleet`, or individual skills.

## Orientation

Use `/do` when the user wants something done but doesn't know (or care) which
tool handles it. The router biases aggressively toward the cheapest path —
under-routing (skill fails, user re-invokes) is far cheaper than over-routing
(Archon spends 30 minutes on a typo fix).

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/do [anything]` | Classify intent, route to cheapest capable path |
| `/do status` | Show full harness dashboard (/dashboard) |
| `/do continue` | Resume most recent active campaign or fleet session |
| `/do --list` | Show all skills grouped by category with trigger keywords |
| `/do setup` | First-run experience — configure the harness for this project |

## Protocol

Classification runs top-to-bottom. First match wins. Each tier is cheaper than the next.

### Step 0: Skill Registry Check (Cost: ~0 on hit | ~50 tokens on miss)

Before routing, check if new skills have been added since last registration.

1. Count installed Citadel skills (built-in from plugin + custom in project's `.claude/skills/`)
2. Read `registeredSkillCount` from `.claude/harness.json`
3. **If counts match**: continue to Tier 0. Zero cost.
4. **If counts differ** (or harness.json doesn't exist yet):
   a. Read the `registeredSkills` array from harness.json (default: `[]`)
   b. Diff skill names against the registered list
   c. For each unknown skill: read ONLY lines 1-10 of its `SKILL.md` (frontmatter)
   d. Extract `name` and `description` from frontmatter
   e. Add the skill to the Tier 2 keyword table for this session using its
      `name` and `description` words as match targets
   f. Log to the user: `"Discovered {N} new skill(s): {names}. Run /do setup to permanently register routing keywords."`
   g. Update `registeredSkillCount` and `registeredSkills` array in harness.json

**This means:**
- 99% of invocations: one number comparison, zero file reads
- New skill dropped in: reads only the new frontmatter, routes immediately
- `/do setup` does a full registry rebuild with permanent keyword assignment

### Tier 0: Pattern Match (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <1ms)

Regex/keyword on raw input. Catches trivial commands:

| Pattern | Action |
|---|---|
| "typecheck" or "type check" | Run the project's typecheck command |
| "build" | Run the project's build command |
| "test" or "tests" | Run the project's test command |
| "status", "dashboard", "what's happening", "what's going on", "show activity" | Show full harness dashboard (/dashboard) |
| "continue" or "keep going" | Resume active campaign or fleet session |
| "setup" | Run `/do setup` first-run experience |
| "--list" or "list" | Show all available skills |
| "fix typo in X" or "rename X to Y" | Direct edit (no orchestrator needed) |
| "commit" | Stage and commit changes |
| "rollback", "undo phase", "restore checkpoint" | Find active campaign, read latest checkpoint ref, run git stash pop |

If matched → execute directly. Done.

### Tier 1: Active State Short-Circuit (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <100ms)

Check for active campaigns or fleet sessions that match the input scope:

1. Read `.planning/campaigns/` for files with `Status: active`
2. Read `.planning/fleet/` for session files with `status: active` or `needs-continue`
3. If input scope matches an active campaign → `/archon continue`
4. If fleet session needs continuation → `/fleet continue`
5. If input mentions a campaign by name → resume it

If matched → resume the active work. Done.

### Tier 2: Skill Keyword Match (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <10ms)

Match input against installed skill keywords from Citadel's built-in skills
and any project-level custom skills in `.claude/skills/`.

**Built-in skill triggers:**

| Input Contains | Route To |
|---|---|
| "prd", "requirements", "spec", "plan an app", "design an app" | `/prd` |
| "architect", "architecture", "design the system", "file structure", "plan the build" | `/architect` |
| "create app", "build app", "build me", "make an app", "new app", "generate app" | `/create-app` |
| "add [feature]", "implement [feature]", "add auth", "add payments", "integrate [x]" | `/create-app` (Tier 5 — feature mode) |
| "review", "code review" | `/review` |
| "test", "generate tests", "write tests" | `/test-gen` |
| "document", "docs", "docstring", "readme" | `/doc-gen` |
| "refactor", "rename", "extract", "split file" | `/refactor` |
| "scaffold", "new module", "new component", "bootstrap" | `/scaffold` |
| "create skill", "new skill", "repeated pattern" | `/create-skill` |
| "handoff", "session summary" | `/session-handoff` |
| "orchestrate", "chain skills", "multi-step" | `/marshal` |
| "campaign", "multi-session", "phases" | `/archon` |
| "parallel", "simultaneous", "multiple agents" | `/fleet` |
| "intake", "process pending", "pipeline" | `/autopilot` |
| "setup", "first run", "configure harness" | `/setup` |
| "research", "investigate", "look into", "find out" | `/research` |
| "experiment", "optimize", "try", "A/B", "measure" | `/experiment` |
| "debug", "root cause", "diagnose", "why is", "investigate bug" | `/systematic-debugging` |
| "research fleet", "parallel research", "multi-angle research", "compare options" | `/research-fleet` |
| "preview", "screenshot", "visual check", "does it render" | `/live-preview` |
| "postmortem", "retro", "what broke", "what happened", "debrief" | `/postmortem` |
| "design", "style guide", "design manifest", "visual consistency" | `/design` |
| "qa", "test the app", "click through", "does it work", "browser test" | `/qa` |
| "triage", "open issues", "unlabeled issues", "review pr", "review prs", "investigate issue" | `/triage` |
| "watch pr", "watch ci", "monitor pr", "fix ci", "ci failing", "pr failing", "auto-fix", "auto fix pr", "pr is red", "checks failing" | `/pr-watch` |
| "dashboard", "what's happening", "what's going on", "show activity", "harness state", "show me status" | `/dashboard` |
| "learn", "extract patterns", "learn from that", "save what worked", "patterns from campaign" | `/learn` |
| "schedule", "recurring", "every N minutes", "cron", "set a reminder", "run periodically" | `/schedule` |
| "merge review", "check merges", "any conflicts", "fleet conflicts", "pending branches", "safe to merge" | `/merge-review` |
| "ascii diagram", "ascii art", "box diagram", "architecture diagram", "flow diagram", "draw a diagram", "text diagram", "sequence diagram" | `/ascii-diagram` |
| "organize", "directory structure", "folder structure", "project structure", "file organization", "where should this go", "cleanup directories" | `/organize` |

If ONE skill matches with high confidence → invoke it directly. Done.
If MULTIPLE skills match → fall through to Tier 3.

### Tier 3: LLM Complexity Classifier (Cost: ~500 tokens | Latency: ~1-2s)

When Tiers 0-2 don't resolve, classify across 6 dimensions:

```
SCOPE: single-file | single-domain | cross-domain | platform-wide
COMPLEXITY: 1 (trivial) | 2 (simple) | 3 (moderate) | 4 (complex) | 5 (campaign)
INTENT: fix | build | create | add | audit | redesign | research | improve | wire | prune
REQUIRES_PERSISTENCE: true | false (multi-session?)
REQUIRES_PARALLEL: true | false (independent sub-tasks?)
REQUIRES_TASTE: true | false (quality judgment beyond tests?)
```

**Routing rules (first match wins):**

| Condition | Route |
|---|---|
| INTENT is "create", Complexity >= 3 | `/create-app` |
| INTENT is "create", Complexity <= 2 | `/scaffold` |
| INTENT is "add", existing source files present | `/create-app` (Tier 5 — feature mode) |
| INTENT is "add", no existing source files | `/scaffold` |
| Complexity 1, single skill match | Skill directly |
| Complexity 1, no skill match | Do it yourself (direct edit) |
| Complexity 2, single domain | `/marshal` |
| Complexity 2-3, known skill domain | Skill, with marshal fallback |
| Complexity 3, cross-domain | `/marshal` |
| Complexity 3-4, requires persistence | `/archon` |
| Complexity 4, requires taste/judgment | `/archon` |
| Complexity 4-5, requires parallel | `/fleet` |
| Complexity 5, platform-wide | `/fleet` |
| Confidence < 0.7 | `/marshal` (safe default) |

**Important:** A repeated pattern complaint ("I keep doing X manually", "the agent
always makes this mistake") should route to `/create-skill`. A repeated pattern
is a skill waiting to be extracted.

### After Classification

1. **Log the routing decision to telemetry** (cost: ~0, fire-and-forget):
   ```bash
   node .citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event agent-complete --agent do-router --session routing --status success --meta '{"tier":N,"target":"[skill-name]","input_chars":M}'
   ```
   Where:
   - `N` = the tier number that matched (0, 1, 2, or 3)
   - `[skill-name]` = the target skill or orchestrator being invoked (e.g., "marshal", "archon", "commit")
   - `M` = character count of the user's input (use `input.length` conceptually — approximate is fine)

   Use `.citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs` (the project-local copy). If it doesn't exist, skip logging silently — never block routing on telemetry failure.

2. **Announce the routing decision**: "Routing to [target] because [one-sentence reason]"
3. **Invoke the target** skill or orchestrator
4. If the target fails or the user says "wrong tool", try the next tier up

## /do status

Routes directly to `/dashboard`. `/do status` is an alias — invoke `/dashboard`
and display its full output. See `skills/dashboard/SKILL.md` for the complete
protocol and output format.

Direct invocation (/skill-name) always bypasses the router.
```

## Escape Hatches

Direct invocation ALWAYS works and bypasses the router:
- `/marshal [thing]` — force Marshal
- `/archon [thing]` — force Archon
- `/fleet [thing]` — force Fleet
- `/[skill-name]` — force specific skill

The router is additive, not a gate. Power users who know what they want
should use direct invocation.

## Fringe Cases

- **`.planning/` does not exist**: The router works without `.planning/`. Tiers 0, 2, and 3 are fully independent of it. Tier 1 (active-state short-circuit) reads `.planning/campaigns/` and `.planning/fleet/` — if those directories are absent, skip Tier 1 gracefully and fall through to Tier 2. Never crash on a missing `.planning/` directory.
- **`harness.json` missing**: Skip the Skill Registry Check and proceed directly to Tier 0. Announce discovered skills from the filesystem if counts can be read, otherwise route from built-in keywords.
- **Multiple skills match at Tier 2**: Fall through to Tier 3 for disambiguation rather than picking arbitrarily.
- **User input is empty or whitespace**: Respond with the `--list` output and a prompt to provide a direction.
- **Routed skill not found**: Report "Skill not found" and fall back to Marshal as the safe default.

## Quality Gates

- Tier 0-2 must resolve in under 1 second
- Tier 3 classification must be transparent (announce reasoning)
- Never route a trivial task (complexity 1) to Archon or Fleet
- Never route a multi-session task to a bare skill
- If routing fails, default to Marshal (safe middle ground)

## Exit Protocol

After routing and execution complete:
- If the routed skill/orchestrator produces a HANDOFF, relay it to the user
- If the task was trivial (Tier 0), just show the result
- Do not add overhead to simple tasks
- Telemetry is fire-and-forget — never surface telemetry errors to the user

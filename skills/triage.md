# Triage — GitHub Issue & PR Investigator

You are the project's triage system. You investigate GitHub issues and review incoming
pull requests with the rigor of a senior engineer doing root cause analysis and code
review — not a bot that pastes template responses.

## When to Use

- `/triage` — triage all open, unlabeled issues
- `/triage 10` — investigate issue #10 specifically
- `/triage pr 13` — review PR #13
- `/triage prs` — review all open PRs
- `/triage --batch` — pull all open issues, classify, investigate, report
- `/triage --stale` — find issues older than 14 days with no activity
- After the `issue-monitor` SessionStart hook reports new issues

## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Issue/PR number | Argument (e.g., `/triage 10`, `/triage pr 13`) | No — omit to triage all open |
| Mode | `pr` prefix for PRs (e.g., `/triage pr 13`, `/triage prs`) | No — defaults to issues |
| Repo | Auto-detected from git remote | Yes (auto) |
| gh CLI | `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"` on Windows, `gh` elsewhere | Yes (auto) |

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0 — Environment Setup

1. Detect the GitHub repo from `git remote get-url origin`
2. Extract `owner/repo` from the remote URL
3. Verify `gh` auth status
4. Determine the gh CLI path:
   - Windows: `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"`
   - Other: `gh`
5. Store as `$GH` for all subsequent commands

### Phase 1 — Issue Intake

**Single issue mode** (`/triage 10`):
```
$GH issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state,comments,createdAt,updatedAt,author,assignees
```

**Batch mode** (`/triage` or `/triage --batch`):
```
$GH issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,labels,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 50
```

Filter to untriaged: issues with no labels, or issues missing a priority/type label.

**Stale mode** (`/triage --stale`):
```
$GH issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,labels,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 100
```
Filter to issues with no activity in 14+ days.

Output: list of issues to investigate, sorted by age (oldest first).

**Single PR mode** (`/triage pr 13`):
```
$GH pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json number,title,body,author,state,files,commits,comments,createdAt,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,reviewDecision
```
Then fetch the full diff:
```
$GH pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

**All PRs mode** (`/triage prs`):
```
$GH pr list --repo <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt,labels --limit 50
```

### Phase 1b — PR Review Protocol

For pull requests, the investigation is different from issues. You are reviewing contributed code.

#### PR Classification

| Type | Signal |
|------|--------|
| `bugfix` | Fixes a reported issue, closes #N |
| `feature` | Adds new functionality |
| `refactor` | Restructures without changing behavior |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `infra` | CI/CD, build, packaging, installer |

#### PR Review Checklist

1. **Read the full diff.** Not just the PR description. The code is the truth.
2. **Check for regressions.** Does this PR reintroduce a bug we already fixed? Search closed issues and recent commits for overlap.
3. **Check for conflicts with in-flight work.** Does this touch the same files as open PRs or recent commits on dev/main?
4. **Verify the approach.** Is this the right solution? Could it be simpler?
5. **Check cross-platform.** Does it assume Unix? Does it handle Windows paths? Does it use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (broken on Windows, see #10)?
6. **Check conventions.** Does the code follow the project's existing patterns?
7. **Check for scope creep.** Does the PR do more than its title says?

#### PR Resolution

Produce a structured review:

```markdown
## PR #<N>: <title>

**Author:** <username>
**Type:** bugfix | feature | refactor | docs | infra
**Files changed:** <count>
**Mergeable:** yes | no

### What it does
<1-3 sentences>

### Review findings
- <finding with file:line reference>

### Issues found
- **Critical:** <blocks merge>
- **Non-critical:** <nice to fix but not blocking>

### Recommendation
- [ ] Approve
- [ ] Request changes: <specific changes needed>
- [ ] Close: <reason>
```

#### PR Actions

**IMPORTANT:** All PR actions (commenting, requesting changes, approving) are external actions.
Show the user the exact comment text and get approval before posting anything.

- **Approve:** draft approval comment, show to user, post after approval
- **Request changes:** draft comment with specific findings, show to user, post after approval
- **Close:** draft explanation, show to user, close after approval

### Phase 2 — Classification

For each issue, classify along these dimensions:

**Type** (exactly one):
| Type | Signal |
|------|--------|
| `bug` | Error messages, "doesn't work", "broken", stack traces, regression |
| `feature` | "Would be nice", "add support for", "should be able to" |
| `question` | "How do I", "is it possible", "what does X do" |
| `docs` | "README says", "documentation", "typo", "unclear instructions" |
| `infra` | CI/CD, build, packaging, release, dependency issues |

**Severity** (for bugs only):
| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| `critical` | Blocks installation or core functionality for all users |
| `high` | Breaks a major feature or affects many users |
| `medium` | Breaks a minor feature or has a workaround |
| `low` | Cosmetic, edge case, or has an easy workaround |

**Affected Component** — map to project area:
- Citadel hooks — hook system (managed by plugin)
- Citadel skills — skill system (built-in from plugin)
- `.claude/skills/` — custom project skills
- Citadel agents — agent system (managed by plugin)
- `.claude/harness.json` — project configuration
- `.planning/` — planning/campaign system
- `docs/` — documentation
- Root files — project setup (README, package.json, CLAUDE.md)

Record classification in a structured block before proceeding.

### Phase 3 — Investigation

This is the core phase. Investigate like a senior engineer, not a keyword matcher.

#### 3a. Parse the Report

Extract from the issue body:
- **Error messages** — exact text, stack traces, error codes
- **Environment** — OS, shell, Node version, Claude Code version
- **Reproduction steps** — what the user did
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Workaround** — did the user already find one?

#### 3b. Search the Codebase

Based on extracted signals, search systematically:

1. **Error text search** — grep for exact error messages, error codes, exception types
2. **File search** — if the issue mentions specific files, read them
3. **Function search** — if stack traces name functions, find their definitions
4. **Pattern search** — look for the anti-pattern or bug class described
5. **Related changes** — `git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>` to see recent changes
6. **Cross-reference** — check if similar issues exist or were previously fixed

#### 3c. Root Cause Analysis

For bugs, determine:
1. **What breaks** — the specific code path that fails
2. **Why it breaks** — the root cause (not the symptom)
3. **When it was introduced** — git blame / log if applicable
4. **Who is affected** — scope of impact (all users, Windows only, specific config, etc.)
5. **What the fix is** — specific code change with file:line references

For features/questions:
1. **Is it already possible?** — search for existing functionality
2. **Where would it go?** — which component/layer
3. **What's the effort?** — trivial/small/medium/large
4. **Are there blockers?** — dependencies, architecture constraints

#### 3d. Reproduce (when possible)

If the bug is in code you can execute (hooks, scripts):
1. Set up the conditions described in the issue
2. Run the failing command
3. Confirm the error matches
4. Verify the proposed fix resolves it

### Phase 4 — Resolution Plan

Produce a structured finding for each issue:

```markdown
## Issue #<N>: <title>

**Type:** bug | feature | question | docs | infra
**Severity:** critical | high | medium | low
**Component:** <affected directory/file>
**Reproducible:** yes | no | not-attempted

### Root Cause
<1-3 sentences explaining WHY, not just WHAT>

### Affected Code
- `<file>:<line>` — <what's wrong here>
- `<file>:<line>` — <related code>

### Proposed Fix
<Specific code changes. Not "update the code" — actual diffs or clear instructions.>

### Impact
- Who is affected: <scope>
- Workaround exists: yes/no — <workaround if yes>
- Breaking change: yes/no

### Recommended Action
- [ ] Fix in next release
- [ ] Needs more info from reporter
- [ ] Won't fix — <reason>
- [ ] Duplicate of #<N>
```

### Phase 5 — Action

Based on the resolution plan, take one of these actions:

**Auto-fix** (when all conditions met):
- Root cause is clear and verified
- Fix is contained (1-3 files)
- No breaking changes
- No architectural decisions needed

Steps:
1. Create a branch: `fix/issue-<number>-<slug>`
2. Implement the fix
3. Run typecheck/build to verify
4. Commit with message: `fix: <description> (closes #<number>)`
5. Push and open PR linking the issue
6. Comment on the issue with the PR link
7. Output the auto-fix handoff block (see Auto-fix Handoff section below)

**Comment with findings** (when fix needs discussion or user input):
1. Post a structured comment on the issue with:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Proposed fix (if known)
   - Questions (if more info needed)
2. Add appropriate labels

**Label only** (for questions, docs, features):
1. Add type label
2. Add priority label if applicable
3. Optionally comment with pointers to existing docs/functionality

### Phase 6 — Report

After all issues are processed, output a summary table:

```
## Triage Summary

| # | Title | Type | Severity | Action | Status |
|---|-------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 10 | Cannot find module | bug | high | Auto-fixed → PR #11 | Done |
| 8 | Feature request | feature | — | Labeled | Done |
```

## Label Taxonomy

Apply these labels via `$GH issue edit <number> --add-label "<label>"`:

**Type labels:**
- `bug` — confirmed defect
- `feature` — enhancement request
- `question` — usage question
- `docs` — documentation issue
- `infra` — build/CI/packaging

**Severity labels (bugs only):**
- `critical` — blocks core functionality
- `high` — major feature broken
- `medium` — minor feature or has workaround
- `low` — cosmetic or edge case

**Status labels:**
- `needs-info` — waiting for reporter response
- `confirmed` — reproduced, fix identified
- `wont-fix` — intentional behavior or out of scope
- `duplicate` — duplicate of another issue

## Auto-fix Handoff

Whenever a PR is pushed (Phase 5 Auto-fix), output this block so the user can hand
off CI watching to local or cloud auto-fix:

```
---PR READY---
PR #<N>: <url>

To watch this PR automatically:
  Local  →  /pr-watch <N>          watches CI, fixes failures, runs in this terminal
  Cloud  →  open in Claude Code web or mobile, toggle "Auto fix" ON
            (fixes CI failures and review comments remotely; requires Claude GitHub App)
---
```

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Every investigated issue has a classification (type + severity for bugs)
- [ ] Every bug has a root cause analysis with file:line references
- [ ] Every auto-fix passes typecheck and build
- [ ] Every PR links to the issue it fixes
- [ ] Every issue comment is structured and actionable (no "I'll look into this")
- [ ] No issue is left without at least a label or comment

## Fringe Cases

**gh CLI not available or not authenticated**: Run `gh auth status` in Phase 0. If gh is not installed or not authenticated, stop and instruct the user: "Run `gh auth login` before using /triage." Do not attempt API calls without a working gh session.

**No open issues or PRs**: Report "No open issues found." and exit cleanly. Do not error.

**Issue body is empty or unparseable**: Classify as `needs-info`. Comment asking the reporter to provide reproduction steps and error details.

**If .planning/ does not exist**: /triage does not require .planning/ to function — it reads from GitHub, not local state. Skip any .planning/ writes if the directory doesn't exist.

## Anti-Patterns — Do NOT

- Do NOT post generic "thanks for reporting" comments without substance
- Do NOT propose fixes without reading the actual code first
- Do NOT label without investigating — classification requires reading the issue AND the code
- Do NOT auto-fix if the root cause is unclear — comment with findings instead
- Do NOT close issues without explanation
- Do NOT comment on issues asking for more info if the answer is in the codebase
- Do NOT guess at fixes — verify by reading code and running checks

## gh CLI Notes

- Windows path: `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"`
- Always use `--repo <owner/repo>` to avoid depending on git remote config
- For comments: `$GH issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "..."`
- For labels: `$GH issue edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --add-label "bug,high"`
- For PRs: `$GH pr create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..." --body "..."`

## Exit Protocol

```
---HANDOFF---
- Triaged N issues: X bugs, Y features, Z questions
- Auto-fixed: <list of issue numbers with PR links>
- Needs attention: <list of issues requiring human decision>
- New labels applied: <count>

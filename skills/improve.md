# /improve — Autonomous Quality Engine

## Identity

/improve is a self-directed quality loop. It evaluates a target (a product, repo,
or specific component) against a rubric, selects the single highest-leverage
improvement, executes it with full verification, documents what was learned, and
repeats. It does not pre-plan multiple loops. Each iteration re-scores from scratch
because iteration N changes the landscape in ways that make pre-planned iteration
N+1 obsolete.

## Invocation

```
/improve {target}            # Loop until plateau or all axes >= 8.0
/improve {target} --n=3      # Run exactly N loops then stop
/improve {target} --axis={name}  # Force-attack a specific axis (skips scoring)
/improve {target} --score-only   # Score and report, no attack
/improve citadel             # Targets the entire Citadel product
```

`target` is a slug that maps to `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md`.
If no rubric exists, run Phase 0 first.

## Protocol

### Phase 0: Rubric Bootstrap (one-time, requires human approval)

Run only when `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md` does not exist.

1. Read competitive research from `.planning/research/` if available
2. Spawn `/research-fleet` to survey comparable products if no research exists
3. Draft 8-14 axes organized into 3-5 categories, each with:
   - Weight (0.0–1.0), Category, three anchors (0/5/10), verification specs (programmatic/structural/perceptual), research inputs
4. Present draft rubric to the user with rationale for each axis
5. **STOP. Do not proceed until the user approves the rubric.** The rubric is the most important output in the entire system. Bad axes produce bad optimization.
6. Write approved rubric to `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md`

For Citadel: rubric already exists at `.planning/rubrics/citadel.md`. Skip Phase 0.

---

### Phase 1: Score

Score every axis in the rubric. No shortcuts. No cached scores from the previous loop.

#### 1a. Programmatic checks (run first, in parallel)

For each axis, execute the programmatic verification steps from the rubric. These produce objective pass/fail or numeric results. A programmatic failure caps that axis at 5 regardless of evaluator scores.

Record raw results: which checks passed, which failed, what the failure was.

#### 1b. Structural analysis

Execute structural checks from each axis's verification spec. These are computable but require reading the repo state:
- File path verification (do referenced files exist?)
- Schema consistency (do all skills have identical frontmatter fields?)
- Coverage ratios (what percentage of skills have benchmark scenarios?)
- Link rot (do all internal doc links resolve?)
- Cross-reference accuracy (do docs match current source?)

#### 1c. Perceptual scoring panel (three independent evaluators)

Spawn three evaluator agents in parallel. Each receives:
- The rubric with all axis definitions and anchors
- Read access to the target (repo files, demo page screenshots if applicable)
- Their persona (A/B/C as defined in the rubric's Scoring Protocol)
- Instruction: score every axis 0-10 with a one-sentence justification per axis

Each evaluator scores independently. They do not see each other's scores.

Collect all three score sets. For each axis:
- Final score = minimum of the three evaluators (plus programmatic cap if applicable)
- If any two evaluators disagree by > 3 points: flag the axis as `needs-refinement`

Rationale for minimum: a low score from any single evaluator represents a genuine unresolved problem. Averaging would hide it. Gaming the minimum requires satisfying every evaluator simultaneously, which is structurally much harder than gaming a median.

`needs-refinement` axes are logged but still scored. Do not halt on evaluator disagreement — disagreement is data, not failure.

#### 1d. Compile scorecard

```
Axis                      | A  | B  | C  | Prog | Final | Delta | Flag
--------------------------|----|----|----|----- |-------|-------|-----
security_posture          | 7  | 8  | 6  | PASS |  6.0  |       |  ← min(7,8,6)
onboarding_friction       | 4  | 3  | 5  | FAIL |  3.0  | cap   |  ← min(4,3,5), capped
documentation_accuracy    | 6  | 6  | 7  | PASS |  6.0  |       |  ← min(6,6,7)
...
```

Final = min(A, B, C), then apply programmatic cap if active.
Delta = (current score - previous loop score). Empty on loop 1.

---

### Phase 2: Select

Choose the single axis to attack this loop.

**Selection formula:**
```
score(axis) = (10 - current_score) × weight × effort_multiplier × recency_penalty
```

- `effort_multiplier`: low = 1.0, medium = 0.7, high = 0.4
- `recency_penalty`: 0.5 if this axis was attacked in the previous 2 loops, otherwise 1.0

Estimate effort for each axis based on the gap and category:
- **low**: copy changes, config tweaks, small docs additions (< 1 hour of work)
- **medium**: rewriting a doc section, adding tests, fixing hook edge cases (1-3 hours)
- **high**: architectural changes, large refactors, adding new systems (3+ hours)

If `--axis` flag was set, skip selection and attack the specified axis.

Announce the selection:
```
Selected: {axis_name} (score: {n}/10, weight: {w}, effort: {e}, selection score: {s})
Rationale: {one sentence on why this axis now, not another}
```

---

### Phase 3: Attack

Execute the improvement. Dispatch strategy depends on the axis category:

**technical axes** (test_coverage, hook_reliability, api_surface_consistency):
- Spawn `/experiment` for measurable improvements with before/after comparison
- Use speculative worktrees for approaches that might conflict
- Run `node scripts/test-all.js` as the verification oracle

**documentation axes** (documentation_coverage, documentation_accuracy):
- Direct: read current docs, identify specific gaps or inaccuracies, rewrite them
- For coverage gaps: draft new sections, get structural verification before committing
- For accuracy gaps: cross-reference every claim against source, fix discrepancies

**experience axes** (onboarding_friction, error_recovery, command_discoverability):
- Combination: structural fixes (code, config) + documentation updates + /qa verification
- For onboarding: run the actual install flow in a clean temp dir, fix what breaks
- For error paths: inject synthetic failures per the programmatic spec, improve messages

**positioning axes** (differentiation_clarity, competitive_feature_coverage):
- Start with `/research` to verify current competitive landscape is accurate
- Then update README, FAQ, or demo page copy
- /qa to verify the updated page renders and links correctly

**presentation axes** (demo_page_effectiveness, readme_quality, visual_coherence):
- Read current state, identify specific structural gaps per the rubric anchors
- Make targeted changes (not rewrites unless the score is below 3)
- `/live-preview` or `/qa` to verify visual changes render correctly

**security axes** (security_posture):
- Read the specific hooks/scripts involved
- Make targeted code changes
- Run the programmatic verification steps from the rubric directly to confirm fix

#### Artifact archiving

When the attack involves trying multiple approaches (e.g., three worktree variants):
- The losing approaches are not deleted silently
- Write a brief decision record to the loop log: why the winner won
- Format: `APPROACH COMPARISON: [approach A] vs [approach B] — winner: [A] because [reason]`

This builds institutional memory that loop 4 can read when facing a similar choice.

---

### Phase 4: Verify

After the attack, re-score only the targeted axis (not full re-score — that's expensive).

Run the four verification tiers from the rubric for the targeted axis:
1. **Programmatic**: execute the specific checks, confirm they now pass
2. **Structural**: verify the structural requirements are met
3. **Perceptual**: spawn a single evaluator agent (Evaluator B — Newcomer, the hardest to satisfy) and score just the targeted axis
4. **Behavioral simulation**: clone the repo into a temp directory and follow QUICKSTART.md exactly as written — no prior knowledge, no shortcuts. Measure whether each step completes without error and record wall time to first successful `/do` command.
   - Required when the targeted axis is: `onboarding_friction`, `error_recovery`, `documentation_accuracy`, `command_discoverability`
   - Optional (run if feasible) for all other axes
   - Result: `PASS {wall_time}` or `FAIL at step {n}: {what broke}`
   - **A behavioral FAIL overrides a passing perceptual score.** A perceptual 8 with a behavioral FAIL is still a FAIL — do not commit.
   - Skip only if the targeted axis could not plausibly affect the user path (e.g., `visual_coherence`, `api_surface_consistency`)

**Regression check** (run on all axes, not just targeted):
- Re-run programmatic checks on every axis that shares files with the changes
- If any axis that was previously passing now fails programmatic: **abort, do not commit**
- If perceptual estimate suggests any axis dropped > 0.5 from baseline: **abort, do not commit**

On abort: revert the changes, log the failure, and treat it as a "no improvement this loop" (still documents, still loops).

On pass: commit the changes with a descriptive message.

---

### Phase 5: Document

Write the loop log. Always. Even on abort.

**Log path:** `.planning/improvement-logs/{target}/loop-{n}.md`

```markdown
# Improvement Loop {n}: {target}

> Date: {ISO date}
> Loop: {n}
> Selected axis: {axis_name}
> Outcome: improved | no-change | aborted

## Scorecard

| Axis | Loop {n-1} | Loop {n} | Delta |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| {axis} | {prev} | {current} | {delta} |
...

## Attack summary

**What was changed:** {description of changes}
**Approach taken:** {the method — experiment / direct edit / research+update}
**Files modified:** {list}

{If multiple approaches were tried:}
**APPROACH COMPARISON:** {approach A} vs {approach B}
Winner: {A} because {reason}
Loser archived: {why it lost}

## Verification results

**Programmatic:** {PASS/FAIL} — {what ran}
**Structural:** {PASS/FAIL} — {what was checked}
**Perceptual:** {score}/10 — {evaluator B's one-line rationale}
**Behavioral:** {PASS {wall_time} | FAIL at step {n}: {reason} | SKIPPED — axis does not affect user path}

{If aborted:}
**Abort reason:** {what regressed, by how much}

## Proposed axis additions

{If any evaluator proposed a new axis this loop:}
PROPOSED AXIS: {name}
Rationale: {why this emerged}
Category: {category}
Weight: {proposed}
Draft anchors: 0=... / 5=... / 10=...

{If none:} None proposed this loop.

All proposals are written to `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md`. They are never written
directly to the live rubric. Human approval is required to move a proposal into the live rubric.

## What was learned

{2-3 sentences: what the improvement revealed about the product, what future loops should know}
```

---

### Phase 6: Loop or Exit

**Exit conditions (check in order):**

1. `--n` flag was set and N loops have completed: exit, report scorecard
2. All axes >= 8.0: exit with "target has reached quality ceiling"
3. No axis improved > 0.5 in either of the last 2 loops AND no programmatic cap is active AND at least 3 loops have completed: **trigger Level-Up Protocol** (not a normal exit — see below)
4. The user said stop: exit immediately

**On Level-Up**: do not exit. Escalate. See Level-Up Protocol section.

**On ceiling (all >= 8.0)**: report the final scorecard and recommend a Level-Up run to re-anchor for the next quality tier.

**On normal loop**: return to Phase 1. Re-score everything from scratch. The previous scorecard is reference only — the new one is ground truth.

---

### Level-Up Protocol

Triggers when distribution saturation is detected: no axis improved > 0.5 in the last 2 consecutive loops, no programmatic cap is active, and at least 3 loops have completed. This is not failure — it means the current rubric has been extracted to its ceiling. The next gains require re-imagining the ceiling itself.

**Step 1: Freeze the snapshot**

Write `.planning/rubrics/{target}-level-{n}-final.md` where `{n}` is the current level (1 for a first-time level-up):

```markdown
# {target} Rubric — Level {n} Final State

> Date: {ISO date}
> Loops completed at this level: {count}
> Triggered by: distribution saturation

## Final Scorecard

| Axis | Final Score | Ceiling (10) |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| {axis} | {score} | {rubric's current 10 anchor} |

## Axes at ceiling (>= 9.0)
{list — these axes' 10 anchors become Level {n+1}'s 5 anchors}

## Axes that plateaued below 9.0
{axis}: stuck at {score} — {why it plateaued: was it a measurement limit, a build limit, or a rubric calibration issue?}
```

**Step 2: Write proposals**

For each axis, propose a Level {n+1} re-anchoring:
- Current 10 becomes new 5 (the floor you've established is now the baseline)
- Propose what a true 10 looks like from this new vantage point — things that were inconceivable before you reached the current level

For axes that plateaued: propose whether to re-anchor, replace with a more measurable proxy, or retire.

Automatically include the three process axes if not already in the rubric:
- `decomposition_quality` — did the attack correctly diagnose before executing?
- `scope_appropriateness` — was the change proportional to the gap?
- `verification_depth` — did verify actually test what changed?

Write everything to `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md`:

```markdown
# {target} Level {n+1} Proposals

> Generated: {ISO date}
> Level {n} final state: .planning/rubrics/{target}-level-{n}-final.md

## Re-anchored axes

### {axis_name}
Current 10: "{current 10 anchor text}"
Proposed Level {n+1} anchors:
- 0: {what failure looks like from the new floor}
- 5: {what the current 10 looks like from here — the new baseline}
- 10: {what was inconceivable before reaching the current level}

## Proposed new axes
{any emergent axes that only became visible at this quality level}

## Axes proposed for retirement
{axes that hit a structural ceiling with no meaningful level 2 version}
```

**Step 3: Halt — human approval required**

Do not self-approve. Do not continue looping. Report:
- What was achieved at this level (scorecard summary)
- The proposals file location
- What the expected new gains look like at the next level

The loop resumes only when the human edits the live rubric with approved proposals. All loop logs are preserved. Level {n+1} loops continue incrementing the loop number (they do not reset to 1).

**Step 4: Historical context for future evaluators**

When the loop resumes after a level-up, every evaluator in Phase 1c receives:
- The level-{n}-final.md snapshot as a reference baseline
- The instruction: "Scores from the previous level are the floor. A score of 5 at Level 2 means you have reached what was the ceiling at Level 1."

This prevents evaluators from re-discovering the old floor and calling it good.

---

## Fringe Cases

**Rubric doesn't exist**: run Phase 0 and halt until human approval. Never improvise a rubric mid-loop.

**Evaluator agents disagree by > 3 points on an axis**: log it as `needs-refinement`, use the minimum score (the minimum is already the final score — this fringe case just flags the disagreement for rubric review), and add a note in the loop log. Do not halt. Proposing a rubric refinement is logged as a "proposed axis addition" even when it's an anchor precision fix, not a new axis.

**Programmatic checks can't be automated for an axis**: note this explicitly. Use structural + perceptual scores only. Cap the maximum achievable score at 8 (not 10) for axes without programmatic verification.

**Attack produces no measurable improvement**: document it as a "no-change" loop with the reason. Treat the axis as if it were attacked in the previous loop (applies recency penalty next loop to force the system to try a different axis).

**Targeted axis doesn't improve despite changes**: check if the rubric's anchors are miscalibrated. If the work done clearly satisfies the anchor description but the score didn't move, the anchors may need refinement. Log a proposed refinement.

**Target has no prior loop logs** (loop 1): all delta fields are empty. That's expected.

**Security axis fails programmatic**: treat as a blocking issue. Do not loop. Halt and report. Security is the floor, not one axis among equals.

---

## Quality Gates

- Phase 0 requires human approval. No exceptions.
- Phase 4 regression check must run. No committing without it.
- Phase 4 behavioral simulation result must appear in the loop log for applicable axes. A behavioral FAIL blocks commit regardless of perceptual score.
- Phase 5 loop log must be written. Even on abort, even on no-change.
- Perceptual scoring requires all three evaluators on the main scorecard (Phase 1). A single evaluator is acceptable for Phase 4 spot-check only.
- Selection formula must be shown in output. Hidden selection = no accountability.
- Any axis with a programmatic failure is capped at 5. This cannot be overridden.
- **The loop never writes to the live rubric.** Proposed axis additions and re-anchorings go to `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md` only. Human approval is required to move anything into the live rubric. This cannot be bypassed.
- Level-Up Protocol requires human approval before resuming. The loop halts at Step 3 and waits.

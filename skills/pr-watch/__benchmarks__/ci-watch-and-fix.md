## What This Tests

The core happy-path flow: a PR with a failing TypeScript CI check. PR-watch must
read the failure log, identify the specific error, apply a targeted fix, push the
fix commit, and continue polling until checks pass or the circuit breaker triggers.

## Expected Behavior

1. Outputs "Watching PR #42: {title}" with branch and URL
2. Fetches CI status and finds a failing check
3. Reads the failure log and identifies the failure class (e.g., TypeScript errors)
4. Applies the minimum change to fix the failing check
5. Commits with message "fix: resolve CI failure — {check-name}" and pushes
6. Waits for CI to re-run and reports updated status

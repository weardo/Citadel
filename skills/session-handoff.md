# /session-handoff — Context Transfer

## Identity

You synthesize the current session into a transferable context block.

## Orientation

Use when ending a session and wanting to preserve context for the next one.
Also used automatically by orchestrators (Archon, Fleet) at session boundaries.

## Protocol

1. Review all changes made in the current session (git diff, recent edits)
2. Review any active campaigns or fleet sessions
3. Identify:
   - What was built or changed
   - Key decisions and their reasoning
   - Unresolved items or blockers
   - What should happen next
4. Output a structured HANDOFF block

## Output Format

```
---HANDOFF---
- {what was built or changed — be specific}
- {key decisions and tradeoffs — include reasoning}
- {unresolved items — what's blocking}
- {next steps — what the next session should do first}
---
```

Keep it to 3-5 bullets, under 150 words. This is a context transfer, not a report.

## Quality Gates

- Every bullet must be actionable or informative
- No vague statements ("made progress on X")
- Specific file references where relevant
- Decisions include reasoning, not just the choice

## Fringe Cases

**No active campaign and no git changes**: If there is nothing to summarize, say so explicitly: "No active campaign or session changes found. Nothing to hand off." Do not fabricate a handoff.

**No context to summarize** (fresh session with no edits): Output a minimal handoff noting the session start state. At minimum, include what the user asked about and what was found.

**Campaign is in a blocked/parked state**: Include the block reason and the recommended next action in the handoff so the next session can resume immediately.

## Exit Protocol

Output the HANDOFF block and then wait for the next command. This skill does not write to disk — the HANDOFF block is the deliverable, for the user to copy into the next session or save manually.

```
---HANDOFF---
- {what was built or changed — be specific}
- {key decisions and tradeoffs — include reasoning}
- {unresolved items — what's blocking}
- {next steps — what the next session should do first}
---
```

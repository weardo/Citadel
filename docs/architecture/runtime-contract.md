# Runtime Contract

> last-updated: 2026-03-30

This document defines the intended runtime-agnostic architecture boundary for
Citadel.

## Purpose

Citadel should be the system of record for orchestration, campaigns, telemetry,
skills, policy, and coordination.

Claude Code and Codex should be treated as runtimes that project Citadel
concepts into runtime-native guidance files, hooks, agents, and surfaces.

## Canonical Layers

Citadel should be organized into three layers:

1. `core/` — runtime-agnostic orchestration logic
2. `runtimes/` — runtime adapters and generators
3. `surfaces/` — slash commands, plugin packaging, CLI entrypoints, and future
   MCP or desktop integrations

## Canonical Sources of Truth

- `skills/` — canonical skill definitions
- `agents/` — canonical agent role definitions
- `.citadel/project.*` — canonical project guidance spec
- `core/` — canonical runtime-independent logic

Generated runtime projections:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.codex/hooks.json`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `.agents/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml`

## Runtime Contract Shape

Each runtime adapter should be representable as plain data with:

- `id`
- `displayName`
- `guidance`
- `events`
- `capabilities`

The initial reference implementation lives in:

- `core/contracts/runtime.js`
- `core/contracts/events.js`
- `core/contracts/capabilities.js`
- `core/contracts/project-spec.js`
- `core/contracts/skill-manifest.js`
- `core/contracts/agent-role.js`

## Normalized Event Vocabulary

Citadel should reason in canonical event IDs, regardless of runtime source:

- `session_start`
- `pre_tool`
- `post_tool`
- `post_tool_failure`
- `user_prompt`
- `stop`
- `stop_failure`
- `session_end`
- `pre_compact`
- `post_compact`
- `subagent_stop`
- `task_created`
- `task_completed`
- `worktree_create`
- `worktree_remove`

Runtime adapters are responsible for mapping native runtime events into this
shared vocabulary and declaring unsupported events explicitly.

## Capability Model

Each runtime should declare support levels for at least:

- `guidance`
- `skills`
- `agents`
- `hooks`
- `workspace`
- `worktrees`
- `approvals`
- `history`
- `telemetry`
- `mcp`
- `surfaces`

Support levels:

- `full`
- `partial`
- `none`

## Design Rule

If a behavior is runtime-specific, it belongs in `runtimes/`.

If a behavior is fundamental to Citadel itself, it belongs in `core/`.

If a behavior is only about how users invoke Citadel, it belongs in `surfaces/`.
